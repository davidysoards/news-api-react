# News API React ðŸ“°

This project is deployed via GitHub pages at [News API React](https://davidysoards.github.io/news-api-react).

## Sass & CSS Modules

I used CSS Modules along with SCSS to scope the styles for each component in the UI to only that component. Globally there I'm also using Normalize.css along with some custom resets and styles.

## Parcel

I used my own custom Parcel setup for React to compile the application.

## Axios

Axios was used to make AJAX calls to the News API.
